Strangely, The robot doesn't seem to move at all in auton anymore, it can turn, but it cannot move forward in auton anymore...
Also throwing "Internal issues with print and error tags"... A lot of them, perhaps that happens when the computer disconnects from the robot?
Now the issue seems to occur every time I try to enable the program. Way too many "Internal issues with print and error tags"...
